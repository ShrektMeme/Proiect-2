   <p> The Roblox virtual coin is called Robux, and you can buy Roblox items (virtual avatars, tools, etc.), items to buy with Robux from Roblox games, etc. The first time Roblox was called DynaBlocks.
  Roblox is a video game created in 2006. It is available on multiple platforms (Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Xbox One, iOS and Android). The purpose of this site is to promote the imagination of children by creating their own games; of course, to create more complex games, programming knowledge is needed in LUA 5.0. Roblox is recommended for   children over 6 years of age.</p></div>
